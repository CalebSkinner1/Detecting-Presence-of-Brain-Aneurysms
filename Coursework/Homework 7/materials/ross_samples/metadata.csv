4000000001_4000000300_CustomerService/4000000100.wav|We aren't able to solve this issue without some more information.
4000000001_4000000300_CustomerService/4000000234.wav|I see, so the charges would technically start on the fourth.

3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000001.wav|Yes, I have a lot of furniture and a lot of books.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000131.wav|Are we at the same university?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000073.wav|Yes, I would be very happy about that.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000271.wav|Yeah, some places are very short of water.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000101.wav|We don't have to pay for airline tickets.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000121.wav|I can also get a fridge.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000292.wav|Would it be okay if I could come too?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000137.wav|The answer you gave is incorrect.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000266.wav|Now we can start from the kitchen.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000215.wav|We are very good friends with Sophie and Julia.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000082.wav|What time do we want to start?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000262.wav|I just finished my paper.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000097.wav|Why on earth are you saying it is my fault?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000037.wav|Why don’t you bring it in?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000008.wav|The kitchen is very small.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000175.wav|It started off really well, and just kept getting better.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000253.wav|When did we want to move again?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000171.wav|Lend them a bit of your time and support.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000019.wav|When will you pack your suitcase?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000296.wav|I'm looking for some books for my mother.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000163.wav|Maybe I'll fly there in the winter.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000067.wav|I would take cheese skewers and small snacks.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000109.wav|I also wanted to go there two years ago.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000283.wav|We can also use something blue.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000072.wav|Please don't keep asking me these questions.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000295.wav|Okay, everyone buys their own furniture for their own bedroom.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000174.wav|Lena wants to buy a curtain.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000120.wav|It's a good idea, honey.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000233.wav|I have to know that now.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000279.wav|How do we have to pay the rent?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000272.wav|I dare say it will be.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000230.wav|No, we have not booked anything yet.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000211.wav|In the end that's your choice.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000180.wav|I thought he was nice.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000221.wav|Pick a can, any can.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000118.wav|You can come out and have a look by yourself.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000051.wav|It’s very cold up north.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000013.wav|Is Lena still friends with her?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000158.wav|Here, come to have some grapes.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000205.wav|How well do you feel when you have sunshine?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000270.wav|But you do not stay next to us every day.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000138.wav|You have not suggested anything yet.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000083.wav|Why do you set it free?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000184.wav|You can also clean the bathroom.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000179.wav|I am satisfied with the rent for this luxury apartment.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000038.wav|Are you taking your pets with you?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000119.wav|How big the world is!
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000276.wav|Look, I forgot it again.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000299.wav|Oh, it's on that shelf.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000239.wav|Should I take something to eat?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000130.wav|The problem is, how will we transport everything?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000194.wav|I think that's better too.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000108.wav|I will take clothes and toiletries with me.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000189.wav|That's not a serious question, is it?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000104.wav|Yes, that would work.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000093.wav|We can alternate every week.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000039.wav|Two hours later, he didn’t come back.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000207.wav|What effect does it have on our psyche?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000080.wav|Everyone gets their own bedroom.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000267.wav|Sure, let's take a look.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000126.wav|No, I do not like that, because otherwise everything is black.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000027.wav|I don’t know what that dream is that you have.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000195.wav|We still have to plan everything.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000290.wav|I have not seen her for a long time.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000242.wav|Now they live in a small apartment.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000236.wav|Can you swim there or are there any sharks?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000160.wav|We can fly with my helicopter.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000232.wav|Yes, I will stay next to you every day.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000049.wav|I did a lot of research and my dad worked there as well.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000089.wav|We can go back to the art gallery tomorrow together.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000102.wav|I think there's a dishwasher in the apartment.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000154.wav|She then walked into her room.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000192.wav|It looks happier than before.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000222.wav|That's fair for everyone.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000076.wav|I still have a good idea.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000079.wav|Where do we get moving boxes?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000023.wav|I've never been there.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000257.wav|You can wrinkle up with cheer.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000190.wav|What do you think you're going to buy?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000229.wav|Maybe she likes those clothes.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000202.wav|Because they are so intelligent.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000050.wav|But I want to fly in the morning.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000278.wav|We will discuss that later.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000030.wav|The only thing I could find was one single envelope.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000035.wav|I have to clean and then cook food.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000046.wav|Then he probably had an important conversation.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000249.wav|I don’t think we need a microwave.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000275.wav|Some places are sure to be open.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000227.wav|You look happier than usual, what is going on?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000167.wav|Is that your best excuse?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000274.wav|Could you maybe do your art in the balcony?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000010.wav|She asked me to run to the mail room and grab the mail.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000066.wav|Which city do you want to travel to?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000288.wav|Yes, that's a good place to spend a holiday.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000139.wav|Nevertheless, I am proud of myself.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000012.wav|I have to buy sunscreen.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000145.wav|I hope you agree with my suggestions.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000129.wav|Now we have everything planned.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000177.wav|If you want, I can get the curtains.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000153.wav|Since I am the boss, I can plan my vacation myself.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000134.wav|I've tried restarting the computer but it didn't work.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000245.wav|Do you want to sign up too?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000159.wav|You do not have to say anything anymore.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000078.wav|That's a real talent move.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000081.wav|I will come to office later.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000127.wav|What can I do now?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000096.wav|I would choose rock music.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000173.wav|It may be that he did not see you.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000277.wav|Yes, I'd like to know where you were.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000043.wav|The apartment has three rooms, the house would be enough for us.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000061.wav|I think we should buy black balloons.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000107.wav|He is such a creative person.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000256.wav|I need to sleep now.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000069.wav|You have to explain it to me.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000140.wav|Yes, but let's make it another day when we clean the whole house.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000144.wav|Lena just told me that she can also bring a TV.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000183.wav|I tried to pet him.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000094.wav|I came up with something spontaneously.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000181.wav|Yes, you're right about this.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000090.wav|Yes, tell me the truth.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000281.wav|Lena will get a bucket and three sponges.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000289.wav|I totally understand your situation.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000157.wav|After two months we have holidays again.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000064.wav|Is it okay for you to put her posters in your room?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000246.wav|I want to go somewhere fun with you and Jack.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000063.wav|Which color do you want?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000116.wav|I mean the door should be black and white.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000151.wav|It is full of life and fulfilment.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000047.wav|Tell me what you want to see in New York.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000113.wav|I'm sorry about what happened the other day.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000031.wav|Is there anything left to discuss?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000044.wav|Yes, should I get the cleaning products?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000124.wav|It all works out in the end anyway.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000294.wav|Yes, but we have to buy everything very cheap.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000185.wav|You see, I discovered your little secret.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000255.wav|They know a lot about cars.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000068.wav|Lena has more furniture than you.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000106.wav|Can I use this bowl?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000052.wav|I wish I knew how to ride a bike.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000055.wav|In my opinion, we also need black cutlery.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000110.wav|The job I'm doing now requires a lot of concentration.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000029.wav|You are a really creative person.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000077.wav|I don't know when and where I want to spend it.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000135.wav|That's not our topic now.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000105.wav|Is it okay for her to move in with you?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000298.wav|I have not seen them for a long time.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000117.wav|You don’t know the world is big.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000115.wav|You shouldn't buy two doors.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000133.wav|That's very interesting, I love it.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000024.wav|I can't change it anymore.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000091.wav|That's right, we planned it that way.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000287.wav|I've heard that the environment there is very good.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000261.wav|Yes, that's a good idea.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000041.wav|I was shocked by how she was able to jump so high.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000218.wav|I am so happy for you.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000252.wav|Can you please behave like an adult?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000071.wav|Yes, her mother will sew it for us.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000053.wav|No, our neighbors would not agree with that.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000007.wav|We got into the apartment building.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000216.wav|I'd like to put it in the living room.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000162.wav|I'm looking forward to the holiday.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000016.wav|You say that you are going to help me.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000217.wav|Where are all the labels?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000250.wav|That's the first time I've heard of hot sushi.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000017.wav|We need a hiding place.

3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000054.wav|No, of course I don't have a bike.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000004.wav|People come to celebrate and not to eat.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000268.wav|It seldom rains this summer.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000166.wav|People tend to find happiness.

3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000028.wav|I think your suggestion is great.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000149.wav|He believes he can do that.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000170.wav|Maybe you'll think of something else.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000193.wav|Have we already clarified everything?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000075.wav|Yes, I'm a bit forgetful.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000240.wav|Hello, would you like to move into an apartment with us?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000244.wav|It's worth a million dollars.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000092.wav|At the moment, he might be busy.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000084.wav|Do you have time to cook on weekdays?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000260.wav|Yes, is there something wrong?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000006.wav|No, I don't like that, because sometimes I'm not at home.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000291.wav|I am going back tomorrow.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000085.wav|There are two small rooms and a big room.

3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000186.wav|I knew I had a challenge.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000032.wav|So, I still have five pots and a kettle.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000099.wav|Have we already clarified what we are doing tomorrow?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000165.wav|You will cook Monday and Tuesday.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000045.wav|I think we do not need a microwave.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000057.wav|Have you moved out already?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000280.wav|I’m sure it will be wet when we arrive.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000226.wav|I'll probably go back to town tomorrow.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000219.wav|Yes, honestly, I'm still thinking.

3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000228.wav|What's inside is the same.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000273.wav|Why do you want to give her a blanket?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000214.wav|They are both really nice and pleasant.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000095.wav|She also has a container for toothpaste and toothbrushes.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000005.wav|I did not think about that.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000112.wav|How do you know the area so well?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000196.wav|Yeah, I've been thinking about our relationship for the past few days.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000141.wav|Okay, I agree, but you need to think about it as well.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000285.wav|Oh, how long have you been there?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000201.wav|Everyone should iron their clothes.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000286.wav|Taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000058.wav|Then buy a white and black door.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000136.wav|You will not believe it.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000241.wav|Your father has a moving company.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000128.wav|I still have a kettle and toaster.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000231.wav|Please ask Lena, maybe she has one.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000248.wav|Thank you very much for your hospitality.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000150.wav|We could spend the night on the boat too.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000034.wav|You should find some shelter from the cold night.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000259.wav|My dear, what's for supper?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000234.wav|Is this your last year here?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000074.wav|Yes, I'm really looking forward to it.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000132.wav|We have everything planned now.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000143.wav|We have already clarified the services.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000003.wav|So, I can bring a couch and a washing machine.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000022.wav|It was covered with green buds.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000223.wav|Maybe we can rent a truck.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000269.wav|I always buy clothes online.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000300.wav|Why didn't you come today?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000098.wav|So, Lena will bring a TV.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000200.wav|I had a teacher who taught me that.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000103.wav|Did you make these cakes yourself?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000155.wav|Yes, that would be good.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000026.wav|No, my dog does not bite.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000172.wav|Today my best friend saved my life.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000224.wav|That would be an option too.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000125.wav|How long does the flight actually take?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000210.wav|Yes, she likes to read books.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000146.wav|I would like to take over the kitchen service.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000204.wav|That's good, otherwise we would have to pay for the bike rack.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000198.wav|I have to work to make school interesting.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000114.wav|I threw it at a bird, and it went straight to the plate.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000176.wav|You need to manage your appetite.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000237.wav|I'll get the dishwasher and the oven.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000048.wav|I thought about celebrating it on a boat.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000122.wav|Donny is my little brother.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000178.wav|Set your goal and write down your reasons for them.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000293.wav|I don't have a car.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000088.wav|You'll get everything you want.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000209.wav|Yeah, that is easier said than done.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000009.wav|She had used this perfume before.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000220.wav|Hello, Lena has her birthday on Monday.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000203.wav|Those are their locker numbers.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000182.wav|Do you have time all day?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000169.wav|You should really think about what you're going to bring to the party.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000020.wav|You are all so serious.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000018.wav|Yes, they are also available in black and yellow.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000213.wav|We can talk about cars and organize a car show.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000225.wav|I've got something to go with it.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000284.wav|Yes, I think so too.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000042.wav|Because my pot is too small.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000208.wav|We were so positive all year round.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000254.wav|No, but what happens if you forget your key?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000264.wav|I need to buy a dress.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000033.wav|I want to go there too.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000060.wav|Do you agree with what I just wrote?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000059.wav|You can't just tell me you're not coming at the last minute.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000062.wav|What would it be, for example?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000187.wav|No, but I don't think it's alright that the apartment has no front door.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000014.wav|Yes, the price is too expensive.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000087.wav|That is not a problem.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000199.wav|Should we buy some food?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000206.wav|When does the party take place again?
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000152.wav|We helped each other out.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000156.wav|Yes, that would be a suggestion.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000036.wav|I spent more than I thought I would, cooking this meal.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000123.wav|He is a naughty boy.
0000000001_0300000050_General/0300000025.wav|It requires O E M parts.
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000191.wav|I have a few questions about that.
0000000001_0300000050_General/0200000031.wav|I'm very glad you could come!
0000000001_0300000050_General/0200000023.wav|If you can dream it, you can do it!
3000000001_3000000300_Chat/3000000148.wav|No, I remembered that my father has a moving company.
0000000001_0300000050_General/0100000030.wav|Am I allowed to come with you?
0000000001_0300000050_General/0000000260.wav|Many from these ingredients are our own biological product.
0000000001_0300000050_General/0100000026.wav|Are you sure of this?
0000000001_0300000050_General/0000000185.wav|Seasoning is salt, pepper and perhaps cayenne.
0000000001_0300000050_General/0100000046.wav|Did you see them before you left?
0000000001_0300000050_General/0100000032.wav|May I tell you something?
0000000001_0300000050_General/0200000075.wav|You were meant to be back yesterday!
0000000001_0300000050_General/0200000014.wav|The animals are very happy!
0000000001_0300000050_General/0300000037.wav|What happened to the A C D C poster you had?
0000000001_0300000050_General/0100000016.wav|What do we need for the kitchen?
0000000001_0300000050_General/0000000075.wav|Add fresh sliced peaches to a mason jar with oats, milk and spices, and you've got a sweet peach cobbler-inspired treat waiting for you in the morning.
0000000001_0300000050_General/0100000083.wav|What might you be worrying about?
0000000001_0300000050_General/0100000091.wav|Is his attitude good or not good?
0000000001_0300000050_General/0000000297.wav|I roll a can back and forth on its side.
0000000001_0300000050_General/0300000050.wav|I scored really high on my G R E.
0000000001_0300000050_General/0000000077.wav|It's hard to deny that tomatoes are the ideal summer food - and that's saying a lot in a season where so much produce is at its peak.
0000000001_0300000050_General/0000000140.wav|But tonight, a car stopped at his house, and a policeman helped him get out.
0000000001_0300000050_General/0100000067.wav|What was your biggest break this year?
0000000001_0300000050_General/0000000298.wav|She points to the refrigerator.
0000000001_0300000050_General/0100000096.wav|What can I say about his motivation?
0000000001_0300000050_General/0100000061.wav|What are you talking about?
0000000001_0300000050_General/0000000227.wav|The toy is on the floor.
0000000001_0300000050_General/0100000038.wav|Are you sure that's what they meant?

0000000001_0300000050_General/0200000062.wav|Don't you tell me what to do!
0000000001_0300000050_General/0100000075.wav|Where were you last summer?
0000000001_0300000050_General/0000000223.wav|She was sitting there and she looked so proud.
0000000001_0300000050_General/0100000053.wav|How can we get in touch?
0000000001_0300000050_General/0200000056.wav|Wait, I left my keys in the car!
0000000001_0300000050_General/0100000013.wav|Can you come back tomorrow?
0000000001_0300000050_General/0100000017.wav|Did you catch my drift?
0000000001_0300000050_General/0000000066.wav|In addition to enjoying them raw and cooked in desserts, fresh peaches can be roasted, pickled, and even frozen for a burst of summer sunshine in the middle of winter.
0000000001_0300000050_General/0000000174.wav|They returned home in a hurry and shouted.
0000000001_0300000050_General/0000000248.wav|I'm starving, even though I've eaten dinner.
